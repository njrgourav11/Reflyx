# Adding web-tree-sitter grammars

Place the following WASM files in this directory to enable Tree-sitter-based chunking in serverless functions:

- tree-sitter-javascript.wasm
- tree-sitter-typescript.wasm

You can obtain these from official grammar repositories or prebuilt assets.

If you want a script to fetch these automatically, let me know; I can add a script that downloads and stores them here during build.
